In the ever-evolving world of finance, predicting stock prices has always been a challenging task due to market volatility and complex factors influencing price movements. However, with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning, it is now possible to analyze vast amounts of historical data, identify hidden patterns, and make data-driven predictions. The process begins with data collection, where historical stock prices, technical indicators, news, and market sentiment are gathered. Feature engineering transforms this raw data into meaningful features, such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, and price-volume patterns. An AI model, typically a neural network (like LSTM for time series) or an ensemble method (like XGBoost), is trained on this data, learning to recognize price movement patterns. After training, the model can make future predictions, which are evaluated using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and accuracy. With continuous updates and retraining, the model adapts to changing market conditions, becoming a powerful tool for investors and traders seeking an edge in the stock market.
